# push_swap

Since there is no duplicates:
- Sort an array
- Use those sorted indexes to enumerate each value in the input
- Get median value like the QS algo and make "buckets" and sort each bucket
- Optimize the output string, merge subsequent sa sb and replace by ss for exemple.

- [ ] Check if a number is correct (-3 +1 0 INT_MAX INT_MIN 01 003 for exemple)
